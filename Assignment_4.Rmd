## Question 1
```{r}
n_dims <- sample(3:10, size = 1)
n_dims

my_vector <- (1:n_dims^2)

my_vector <- sample(my_vector)

my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_vector, ncol = n_dims, byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix

t(my_matrix) # transposes matrix
# The columns become the rows

sum(my_matrix[1,])
mean(my_matrix[1,])

sum(my_matrix[n_dims,])
mean(my_matrix[n_dims,])

# n_dims is random and all code is set up to run n_dims randomly

```
