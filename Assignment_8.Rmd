# Data obtained from Veysey Powell and Babbitt 2016: An experimental test of buffer utility as a technique for managing pool-breeding amphibians https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.547rp

dryadData <- read.table("Data/veysey-babbitt_data_amphibians.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE) # read data set into RStudio

# glimpse(dryadData) # Shows preview of data set including number of rows and columns
# head(dryadData) # Shows first 6 rows of data set
# table(dryadData$species) # Shows the total number of Spotted Salamanders and Wood Frogs

dryadData$species<-factor(dryadData$species, labels=c("Spotted Salamander", "Wood Frog")) #creating 'labels' to use for the plot # It changes to data type from character into factor with 2 levels: "Spotted Salamander" and "Wood Frog"

#class(dryadData$treatment) # Shows data type of the "treatment" column
dryadData$treatment <- factor(dryadData$treatment, 
            levels=c("Reference",
                     "100m", "30m")) # Changes the data type from character into factor with 3 levels: "Reference", "100m", and "30m" # Allows these to be labels on the x-axis

p<- ggplot(data=dryadData, 
       aes(x=interaction(wetland, treatment), 
           y=count.total.adults, fill=factor(year))) +
  # The x-axis is determined by the interaction of two variables, "wetland" and "treatment", and the y-axis is determined by the "count.total.adults" variable
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity", color="black") +
  # The geom_bar function makes a bar graph
  ## The position parameter is set to "dodge", which means the bars for each x-value are separated from one another
  ## The stat parameter is set to "identity", which the data value in the data set will be used to determine the size of the bar
  ## The color parameter is set to "black" which means that the bars will be plotted in black
  ylab("Number of breeding adults") + # Creates this label on the y-axis
  xlab("") + # Makes it so there is no x-axis label
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,100,200,300,400,500)) +

  # The scale function determines how the x-axis will be spaced out, including the label names and where they will appear
  ## In this case, the data for this variable is dicrete and is graphed accordingly
  facet_wrap(~species, nrow=2, strip.position="right") +
  # The facet_wrap function creates multiple plots group by the variable after the "~" inside the parenthesis
  ## In this case, the graph is facet wrapped by species type: "Spotted Salamander" and "Wood Frog"
  ## The nrow parameter creates 2 rows for the 2 graphs
  ## The strip position parameter determines where the species label for each graph is placed
  ### In this case, it is specified to be on the right of the graph
  theme_few() + # theme_few sets the theme of the plot ## This particular theme looks very professional
  scale_fill_grey() + # scale_fill_grey makes the whole plot grayscale
